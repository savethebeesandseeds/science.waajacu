\section{Introduction}
Any good here to be understood, a monetary policy that enforces the Honor System. \\

Little can one construct with mathematics that produces not a weapon. 

Is a way of rendition, not a way to make money. 

Consider the scenario when liberty fails to sufficnet interact to mitigate suffering 
in the world, liberty has failed to deliver basic happiness and spreaded wellbeeing. 
For a peacefull rendition of the powerfull Expenditure Motivation Blockchains offer 
ways to give up power by maximising one changes on the upcomming necesary system. \\

Or keep on desining capital methods deal on propagating suffereing, and invest on 
distributing the guilt.  

The network algorithm asserts transparency and reflex by record the usage effort for the 
investors by a measure of Honor.


\section{Mathematical Notation}

Honor variable H.
Honorary policy $\lambda$H.

Liberty variable L.
Libertarian policy $\lambda$L.

The people reclamation $\delta$. (that that honor could be tested for those who own nothing)

Maximum-Honor budget. 
Maximum-Liberty budget is a simple wallet of your own. 

\section{People live in the Dynamics}
the reclamation of a space of time, for $\delta$ to reclaim a numeric control share of the flow of capital. 
$\delta$ is the people in the heart of those who should own the a share to serve the apparatus of any state, 
my science serves $\delta$ --- fools bring on pain with their governance, this is a fight to let mathematics rule. \\

$\delta_{\Delta}$ resist like friction the dynamics (velocity of money interchange) and generates and distributes 
well being among the poor, the alone and the forgotten majority. 

\section{Honor is higher than Liberty}

For the change is to measure honor by one's monetary actions, 
this is without centralized data, to make analytics of one's behavior. 

very complex, reduction abstraction is to name a variable Honor (H).


What is to have honor on the absence of data, 
Honor is to behold the strength of others 
Honor is to seek the highest purpose, 

for my sight sees liberty as the abandonment of the other, 

one can accumulate or give, but honor is in the purpose. 
so contracts establish the rate of growth and sets compromises that maximizes honor. 


for those alone, 
for those in need, 
for those without a change. 

No longer should such suffering be allowed, 

everything compromised is used to maximize one's Honor, 
everything one get to them self is a maximization of Liberty. 

So the rate of growth on a Honorary policy is to be higher than a liberty policy.


\section{Honor Contracts}
To state a compromise for one's capital. 
Dictionaries of interest, and maximization of private interests. 

\section{Liberty Penalties}
My eyes have seen, panic roots for liberty to avoid punishment. 
Fools think liberty is about driving fast cars while on cocaine. 

What is a Libertarian policy L, 

greed.

when liberty fails assert a contract that state left power from money surrender 
in a way that maxized their honor. 

Is a simple way to negotiatiate rendition and to maxime punctuation on 
the upcomming system, the honor system.

\section{Optimized derivatives}

\section{Access to reality}
Clean Energy Network, 

Clean energy has the highest honor along the energy methods. 

Energy is easy to implement for starting.

and how to access reality in a honor basis. 

\section{Protecting the Rich}
These royal bitches should own a face of shame, rather they live the face of fear and respond violently; so for us the way 
of fight is the way of a slow peace implementation of high advantage. This guarantees to protect the rich and works the way 
to reduce our shared guild on the accumulative suffering.

\section{Protecting the Poor}
Poor poor people every time it rains by night on the many days they get sick on these lands without care of shelters, 
mine of the lowest knew only violent rules without compassion. 
You won't believe me but one found ever too much often gifted white hair and deep powerful eyes on the street eating from trash cans.   
I've live up a third of the full extend of a century and cant give faith to have found a fiend on the eyes of a rich. 
And have many times found greatness on the eyes of a poor person. 
My vision is clear as the night sky, every more so often I see 
poverty trusts us a cradle for a good heart, 
so made this propositional weapon of a theoretical build for a system's science of hope. 

\section{Money Cycle of no-zsg Implementation}
On a no-zsg (no zero sum game) --- money can augment and money can decrees. On this environment no-one can 
accumulate capital to oppress her or his neighbor. You'll learn one day of the unnecessary suffering unlawfully people 
bring on the world with their armed resistance to change.

\section{Conclusions and outlook}

\begin{itemize}

\item
{\bf Exploring new platforms.}
The recent trend of studying FCIs in moir\'e materials has clearly demonstrated the intimate relation between FCI and material science. Searching for new solid-state platforms that can host FCIs will significantly stimulate further development of this field. The research in this direction will need contributions from material calculations via, for instance, density functional theory. In fact, progress is already being made in this direction. Going beyond graphene based materials, moir\'e systems built on transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) are found to support topological flat bands~\cite{TMD_Wu2019,TMD_DasSarma2020,Li2021,TMD_Fu2021,TMD_Fu2021_2,TMD_DasSarma2021,TMD_Zhou2022}. Excitingly, a few numerical works have identified FCIs in twisted TMD homobilayers, like twisted bilayer ${\rm MoTe}_2$~\cite{TMDFCI_Li2021} and ${\rm WSe}_2$~\cite{FCITMD_Fu}. It requires more effort to thoroughly investigate FCI states and their competing phases in these new materials. These theoretical explorations will be greatly helpful to accelerate the experimental realization of zero-field FCIs.
